This repository contains code to run simulations described in the article:
"Robust 3D Bloch-Siegert based B1+ mapping using multi-echo general linear modeling."
Corbin N, Acosta-Cabronero J, Malik S, Callaghan MF (2019). MRM, 82(6):2003-2015.

Instructions for the simulations:
Running the script "main.m" will simulate the interleaved Bloch Siegert sequence to produce the output shown in Bloch-Siegert-Simulation-Output.png.

Other options, such as the sequentially ordered approach, can also be simulated by altering the default settings accordingly.
